# Parkinson-Disease-Detection

<br />**Overview**<br />
This repository contains code for analyzing a dataset related to Parkinson's disease using machine-learning techniques. The code demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation to gain insights into the dataset and build predictive models. It is a supervised machine learning model.<br />

<br />**Dataset**<br />
The dataset used in this analysis is 'Parkinsons.csv', which contains various features related to voice recordings of individuals with and without Parkinson's disease.<br />
